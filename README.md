# CARD-FRAUD

## Abstract:
As the world moves faster and faster toward online and card-based 
payment systems, the market for digital payments is increasing 
dramatically.So, It is important to identify fraudulent credit card 
transactions in real time users because for known fraud patterns helps 
detect suspicious activity.To come across the fraudulent activities credit 
card fraud detection machine changed into brought. Such issues can 
be overcomed with the help of machine learning. The algorithms used for 
this method are comes under supervised and unsupervised learning 
techniques.The outcomes of the the algorithms are based totally on 
accuracy and precision. The ROC curve is plotted based on the confusion 
matrix. The algorithms are compared along with the set of rules set of 
rules that has the best accuracy, precision and confusion 
matrix is considered as the best algorithm that is used to identify the 
fraudulent transactions.Our aim is to identify all fraudulent 
transactions while reducing false positives for fraud with the aid 
of growing the accuracy in real time.

## Keywords:
fraudulent activities, machinelearning, supervisedlearning, unsupervisedlearning, accuracy , precision, confusion matrix .

## Introduction:
Machine Learning is widely used to solve the problems that occur in 
our day to day life. To detect the fraudulent transaction Machine Learning 
algorithms can be used. Machine Learning Algorithms can be used to train 
the model. To achieve a more accurate model Multiple experiments have 
been performed to achieve an optimal solution, but it seems that still the 
fraud continues, and we need to keep trying to improve the results as the 
efforts till now are not enough to stop the stealing.
Some of the achievements of techniques involved are Unsupervised 
Learning - Machine Learning Algorithms such as SVM, Logsistic 
regression, etc., do not require labeled data for training the model. They 
identify patterns in the data and try to group the data points based on 
observed similarities in patterns. Supervised Learning - Machine 
Learning Algorithms such as Ensemble Models (RandomForest, .), KNN,
etc. These algorithms are trained on labeled data, and the model learns to 
predict the labels for the unseen data. Labeled data can be expensive to 
gather.
Some notable achievements of machine learning technology in credit 
card fraud detection.It can quickly detect fraudulent transactions in real 
time.Ability to identify previously unknown patterns can improve the 
accuracy of fraud detection.Asaadaptive learning capability allows financial 
institutions to stay ahead of the ever-changing fraud landscape. These 
techniques can detect complex fraud patterns that might be missed by 
traditional fraud detection systems.

## Conclusion:
In this paper, Machine learning techniques like Logistic regression, 
Decision Tree and Random forest, Support Vector Machine,Gaussian 
Naive Bayes,K-Means Clustering ,K NearestNeighbors 
Classifier,adaBoost,GradientBoost were used to detect the fraud in credit 
card system. accuracy and precision are used to evaluate the performance 
for the proposed system.
By comparing all the methods,we found that Out of these algorithms ,the 
Random Forest Algorithm has the highest accuracy
